## Overview 
In this project, we are going to study Bees' data between 2015 and 2019 in order to practice building interactive webpage applications with Python.

## Technologies 
Python 

## Data 
### Data Source 
The data used in this project was provided <a href="https://github.com/Coding-with-Adam/Dash-by-Plotly/tree/master/Other/Dash_Introduction">Coding-with-Adam GitHub</a> 

## Results 
After preparing the data, we have built an interactive Dashboard showing:
* The % of Bees affected by Varroa_mites in every State between the year 2015 and the year 2019.
* The % of colonies affected by different kinds of diseases, in every state, between the years 2015 and 2019.

## Copywrite
This is a guided project done by <a href="https://github.com/Coding-with-Adam/Dash-by-Plotly/tree/master/Other/Dash_Introduction">Coding with Adam</a>. In his tutorial, a dashboard was built with one component each time. In this project, I have combined the 3 components in one dashboard and I have added all the states to the linear chart.
